        <h3 class="test">How It Started</h3>
      <p>
        Billy Mac's was founded by Billy MacDonald, a self-proclaimed gamer and foodie. Growing up, Billy spent countless hours in arcades, competing with friends and family in high-score battles. As he grew older, his love for gaming never faded, but he began to notice a void in the dining scene â€“ a place where people could enjoy delicious food and immersive gaming experiences under one roof.
      </p>
    <p>In 2010, Billy turned his vision into a reality, opening the first Billy Mac's location in a small town. The restaurant quickly gained popularity among locals and gamers alike, thanks to its unique blend of tasty food, craft beers, and classic arcade games.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Billy Mac's has expanded to multiple locations, but its core mission remains the same: to provide a welcoming space for people to come together, enjoy great food and drinks, and indulge in their passion for gaming.
    </p>
    <p>Today, Billy Mac's is a beloved destination for gamers, foodies, and families alike. Whether you're a retro gaming enthusiast or just looking for a fun night out, we invite you to join our community and experience the ultimate gaming and dining destination.</p>
